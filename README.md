## React Price Card Task

   * Reproduce this user interface using a React.js application with JSX. Write the code in a dynamic manner.
   
   * Code in  the [App.jsx](./src/App.jsx) and style in [App.css](./src/App.css).

 **Description**

   * Component Structure: The `App` component is a functional React component that renders pricing cards.

   * Content Array: An array `content` contains objects representing three pricing . plans: FREE, PLUS, and PRO. Each object has properties: `amount`, `head`, `body`, `button`, and `added`.

   * Header Section: A header with the title "React Price Card Task" is rendered.

   * Container for Cards: A container div holds the card list. The card list is mapped from the `content` array.

   * Card Rendering: Each card displays the `amount`, `head` (price), and a list of features (`body`).Features are conditionally displayed with check marks or cross marks.

   * Conditional Logic: For the PLUS plan, features beyond the seventh item are marked with a cross. For the FREE plan, features beyond the fourth item are marked with a cross. For the PRO plan, all features are marked with check marks.

   * Button Styling: A button is included in each card.The button has a conditional `lite` class if the card contains crossed items.

   * CSS File: The `App.css` file is imported for styling. Basic styles include layout (flexbox), card appearance, and feature icons (check and cross marks).
